# Dear current and future student, 
If you are reading this then my work has completed. I have come up with some tutorial and show case of using Splashkit Input which I wish I know when I was in the SIT771. These explaination will be really helpful for completed your tasks such as BankProgram or RobotDodge. Feel free to have a look and best of luck in the future.
